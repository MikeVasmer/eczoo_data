name: 'Concatenated code'

description: 'A concatenated code is a code constrcuted from two error-correcting codes, where the logical information is encoded using a first code, and the encoded result is further encoded using the second code.'

protection: 'Protection depends on the chosen codes.'

#features:
  #gates: 'Keep it succinct for now'
  #fault_tolerance: 'If applicable, any fault-tolerant protocols with the code.'
  #threshold: 'Numerical threshold of 2% \cite{only arxiv:### or doi:###}. Concatenated-scheme threshold of ...'
  #make one that you feel is applicable to a large and interesting class of codes
